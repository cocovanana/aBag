# aBag
WoW Classic bag and bank addon, featuring simplicity and sleek design.

## Intro
Extra simple bag and bank addon for simple people like me!
Sorting is done using [SortBags](https://github.com/shirsig/SortBags), so you'll need to download it for the dot button to appear.
Profession, soul, and ammo bags are displayed in separate containers.
Containers can have titles and different colors.

All config is done in the core/config.lua file!!! There's many configuration options, so take a look!
